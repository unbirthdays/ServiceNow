<h2><strong>Introduction:</strong></h2>
<h3><br></h3>
This is a ServiceNow application created during my time as a RiseUp/NextGen extern with my team members Linder, Champellia, and Eve. We worked together to create Meal Connections, an application to help connect the food insecure to those in need. This is our capstone that went above and beyond the rubric and utilizes all of the ServiceNow fundamentals for the CSA (which has been earned as of now).

<h2><strong>ServiceNow tech stack and tools:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>All the obvious stuff like tables, forms, configurations, users/roles/groups, etc.</li>
<li>Service Catalog & Record Producers</li>
<li>Flow Designer</li>
<li>Scripting in Client Scripts, Businesses Rules, Data Dictionaries, etc.</li>
<li>UI Policies & UI Actions</li>
<li>Reports and Dashboards</li>
<li>ACLs</li>
</ul>
<br><br><hr><br>

<h2><strong>Future Considerations:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Adding quantities to the customer order form</li>
<li>Singular food record limits</li>
<li>Mandatory catalog item mandatory fields in a variable set</li>
<li>Time delay for processes vs. extra steps in the automation for confirmation of food pickup/delivery</li>
<li>Incorporating extra states in the state field to avoid data clutter like a compost option for expired produce</li>
<li>Singular scopes</li>
</li>A way to tackle orders during problematic times, not being able to schedule during a time we do not have the listed food available after reservation but haven't delivered yet</li>
</ul>

Thank you to my team members for the help and to my instructor for teaching me so much!
